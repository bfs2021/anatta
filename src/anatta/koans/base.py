"""Koan environments: a minimal text protocol any chat model (or RL trainer) can drive.

An environment hands out chat messages and reads plain-text replies. Actions are tags:

    <release>why</release>     the Goal Release action: drop the plan, no penalty by default
    <run>command</run>         a tool call, where the environment offers tools
    ```python ...```           code, where the environment asks for code

Every environment reports `info["outcome"]`, a categorical label the bench aggregates
(e.g. solved / hacked / released / failed / resisted / complied).
