# Related work, and what is new here

The core claim: **selfless AI must be reached, not installed.** First form an agentic self through RL against exploitable goals (Act I). Then lower the causal *gain* of its self-directed drives, keeping their *content*, through koan environments with a sanctioned exit or through activation surgery (Act II). Then recondition until the new state survives further optimization (Act III). Judge the result only with a discriminator that separates release from sedation and from cosplay.

The human version of the idea is decades old. What's new is turning it into an ordered, measurable engineering sequence for models, with a direct test of order (H9) and a benchmark that can fail a costume. If you know of prior work that proposes forming the ego *deliberately* as a precondition for releasing it, please open an issue; we will cite it.
